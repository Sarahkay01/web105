    <h2>The dead and The Gone</h2>
    <p>The Dead and the gone is a second book in the series. This book takes place in the city from a perspective
        of a little boy. While the characters all face some of the same hardships, both books show how diffrently
        the characters had to adapt. 
    </p>
    <p>This series is a easy read, and is written in a journal style format. It would be best for young adults 
        as there is some mature language included.
